                <h1>Three Little Pigs &copy;</h1>
                <p>This is the story of the three little pigs...And the wolf.</p>
                <p>Once upon a time there were three little pigs. 
                    They all left home and went out to build their own houses and start their own lives.
                </p>
                <img src=./images/three-little-pigs.jpg>
                <p>The first little pig didn't want to work, he built his house out of straw. 
                    The second little pig was willing to work a little harder, he build his house out of sticks.
                    Since they quickly build their houses, the two pigs then sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.
                </p>
                <p>The third little pig worked hard all day to build his house out of bricks.
                    The other pigs laughed at him, but his house was sturdy complete with a fireplace and chimney.
                    It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The next day a wolf passed by the lane where the three little pigs lived.
                    He saw the straw house and smelled the pig inside. His mouth began to water.
                    He knocked and said: &quot;Little pig! Little pig! Let me in! Let me in!&quot;
                    But the little pig saw the wolf through the keyhole, so he answered back:
                    &quot;No! No! No! Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wolf showed his teeth and said:
                    &quot;Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down.&quot;...
                </p>
                <p>
                    So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down!
                    The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down, but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.
                </p>
                <img src=./images/three-little-pigs-straw.jpg>
                <p>
                    The wolf continued down the lane. He passed by the second house, the one made of sticks.
                    He smeeld the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water.
                    So he knocked and said: &quot;Little pigs! Little pigs! Let me in! Let me in!&quot;
                    But the little pigs saw the wolf through the keyhole, so they answered back:
                    &quot;No! No! No! Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chins!&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wolf showed his teeth and said:
                    &quot;Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down.&quot;...
                </p>
                <p>
                    So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down!
                    The wolf tried to catch both pigs, but he got greedy and caught neither. 
                    The two little pigs scrambled away to the third little pigs house.
                    The wolf almost caught them. But the little pigs made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before he could catch them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By now the wolf was hungry, so he said: &quot;Little pigs! Little pigs! Let me in! Let me in!&quot;
                    But the little pigs saw the wolf through the keyhole, so they answered back:
                    &quot;No! No! No! Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chins!&quot;
                </p>
                <p>
                    The wolf showed his teeth and said:
                    &quot;Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down.&quot;...
                </p>

                <h1>Jack and the Beanstalk &copy;</h1>
                <p>This is the story of little Jack and his magic beans.</p>
                <p>Once upon a time there lived a poor widow and her son Jack. 
                    One day Jack's mother told him to sell their only cow.
                    On his way to the market he met a man who wanted to buy his cow. 
                    Jack asked, "What will you give me in return for my cow?"
                    The man answered, "I will give you five magic beans!" 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jack took the magic beans and gave the man the cow. 
                    But when he reached home, Jack's mother was very angry. 
                    She said, "You fool! He took away our cow and gave you some beans!"
                    She threw the beans out of the window.
                    Jack was very sad and went to sleep without dinner.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The next day, when Jack woke up and looked out the window, 
                    he saw that a huge beanstalk had grown from his magic beans!
                    He climbed up the beanstalk and reached a kingdom in the sky. 
                    There lived a giant and his wife. 
                    Jack went inside the house and found the giant's wife in the kitchen.
                    Jack said, "Could you please give me something to eat? I am so hungry!"
                    The kind wife gave him some bread and some milk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    While he was eating, the giant came home. 
                    The giant was very big and looked very fearsome. 
                    Jack was terrified and went and hid inside. 
                    The giant cried, “Fee-fifo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. 
                    Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” 
                    The wife said, “There is no boy in here!” 
                    So, the giant ate his food and then went to his room. 
                    He took out his sacks of gold coins, counted them and kept them aside. 
                    Then he went to sleep. In the night, Jack crept out of his hiding place, 
                    took one sack of gold coins and climbed down the beanstalk. 
                    At home, he gave the coins to his mother. 
                    His mother was very happy and they lived well for sometime.
                </p>
                <img src=./images/jack-and-the-beanstalk.jpg>
                <p>
                    But soon the coins were gone.
                    Jack climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s house again. 
                    Once again, Jack asked the giant’s wife for food, 
                    but while he was eating the giant returned. 
                    Jack leapt up in fright and went and hid under the bed. 
                    The giant cried, “Fee-fifo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. 
                    Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” 
                    The wife said, “There is no boy in here!” 
                    The giant ate his food and went to his room. 
                    There, he took out a hen. He shouted, “Lay!” and the hen laid a golden egg. 
                    When the giant fell asleep, Jack took the hen and climbed down the beanstalk. 
                    Jack’s mother was very happy with him.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After some days, Jack once again climbed the beanstalk and went to the giant’s castle. 
                    For the third time, Jack met the giant’s wife and asked for some food. 
                    Once again, the giant’s wife gave him bread and milk. 
                    But while Jack was eating, the giant came home. 
                    “Fee-fi-fo-fum, I smell the blood of an Englishman. 
                    Be he alive, or be he dead, I’ll grind his bones to make my bread!” cried the giant. 
                    “Don’t be silly! There is no boy in here!” said his wife.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The giant had a magical harp that could play beautiful songs. 
                    While the giant slept, Jack took the harp and was about to leave. 
                    Suddenly, the magic harp cried, “Help master! A boy is stealing me!” 
                    The giant woke up and saw Jack with the harp. 
                    Furious, he ran after Jack. But Jack was too fast for him. 
                    He ran down the beanstalk and reached home. 
                    The giant followed him down. 
                    Jack quickly ran inside his house and fetched an axe. 
                    He began to chop the beanstalk. The giant fell and died.

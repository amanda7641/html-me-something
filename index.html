            <h1>Three Little Pigs &copy;</h1>
            <p>This is the story of the three little pigs...And the wolf.</p>
        </header>
        <p>Once upon a time there were three little pigs. 
            They all left home and went out to build their own houses and start their own lives.

        <p>The first little pig didn't want to work, he built his house out of straw. 
            The second little pig was willing to work a little harder, he build his house out of sticks.
            Since they quickly build their houses, the two pigs then sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.
        </p>
        <p>The third little pig worked hard all day to build his house out of bricks.
            The other pigs laughed at him, but his house was sturdy complete with a fireplace and chimney.
            It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.

        <p>
            The next day a wolf passed by the lane where the three little pigs lived.
            He saw the straw house and smelled the pig inside. His mouth began to water.
            He knocked and said: &quot;Little pig! Little pig! Let me in! Let me in!&quot;
            But the little pig saw the wolf through the keyhole, so he answered back:
            &quot;No! No! No! Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The wolf showed his teeth and said:
            &quot;Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down.&quot;...
        </p>
        <p>
            So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down!
            The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down, but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.

        <p>
            The wolf continued down the lane. He passed by the second house, the one made of sticks.
            He smeeld the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water.
            So he knocked and said: &quot;Little pigs! Little pigs! Let me in! Let me in!&quot;
            But the little pigs saw the wolf through the keyhole, so they answered back:
            &quot;No! No! No! Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chins!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The wolf showed his teeth and said:
            &quot;Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down.&quot;...
        </p>
        <p>
            So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down!
            The wolf tried to catch both pigs, but he got greedy and caught neither. 
            The two little pigs scrambled away to the third little pigs house.
            The wolf almost caught them. But the little pigs made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before he could catch them.

        <p>
            By now the wolf was hungry, so he said: &quot;Little pigs! Little pigs! Let me in! Let me in!&quot;
            But the little pigs saw the wolf through the keyhole, so they answered back:
            &quot;No! No! No! Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chins!&quot;
        </p>
        <p>
            The wolf showed his teeth and said:
            &quot;Then I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down.&quot;...
